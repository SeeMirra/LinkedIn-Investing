LinkedIn-Investing
==================

Using LinkedIn data to evaluate portfolio performance based on employee movement. 

## People-oriented Investments
My thesis behind investment is it's all about people. 

I begin an investment by beliving in the CEO+Vision. 

Over time, I view how the people hired by company are implementing the product. 

Any time an `implementer` leaves an organization value is shifted. 
How much value is based on: 
+ # of Google references for `implementer` 
+ # of LinkedIn connections 
+ Size of company accepting `implementer`

The value of the `implementer` is shifted to the accepting organization.
